zip/cb_2015*.zip files downloaded in December of 2016 from:
    http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/GENZ2015/shp/
except for cb_2015_us_nation_500k.zip.
They don't produce that one, so I opened the cb_2015_us_region_500k.zip file
in qGIS and combined the regions (Vector -> Geoprocessing Tools -> Dissolve
(on LSAD field)).
